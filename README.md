# GitLab-API-Integration
GitLab Issues Project
Project Description
This project is designed to fetch issues from a GitLab project and save them into a PostgreSQL database. The script connects to the GitLab API, retrieves issue data, and stores this data in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis or reporting.

Features
Fetch issues from a specified GitLab project.
Store the retrieved issues in a PostgreSQL database.
Handle database connection errors gracefully.
Easy to set up and run on your local machine.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or later
PostgreSQL
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
1. Clone the Repository
You can clone this repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gitlab-issues-project.git
cd gitlab-issues-project
```
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To set one up:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. Install the Required Python Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash

pip install requests psycopg2
```
4. Configure the Project
Update the PostgreSQL connection details and GitLab API token in the gitlab_issues_project.py file:

```python
connection = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    database="your_database",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password"
)

gitlab_token = "your_gitlab_access_token"
project_id = "your_project_id"
```
5. Set Up the PostgreSQL Database
Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is running and create a database if it doesn't already exist:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database;
```
Also, ensure that your user has the necessary privileges to connect to this database.
Add file create_table_gitlab_issues.sql to creating right table.

6. Run the Script
Once everything is set up, you can run the script:

```bash
python gitlab_issues_project.py
```
The script will connect to the GitLab API, retrieve issues, and save them to your PostgreSQL database.

Usage Example
The script automatically fetches issues from the GitLab project specified in the configuration and stores them in the PostgreSQL database. You can modify the script to suit your needs, such as filtering issues or customizing the data saved to the database.

Running the Script Periodically
To keep your database updated, you can set up a cron job (on Linux/macOS) or a scheduled task (on Windows) to run this script at regular intervals.

Troubleshooting
Connection Refused to PostgreSQL: Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running and accessible. Check your connection parameters and ensure that the server is listening on the correct port.

GitLab API Errors: Ensure that the GitLab access token and project ID are correct and have sufficient permissions.
